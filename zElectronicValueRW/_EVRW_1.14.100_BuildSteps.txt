EVRW 1.14.100 was built with manual steps because:
 * In the 1.14.001 UnifiedPOS spec, the UnifiedPOS committee added properties
    and methods to EVRW, but chose not to raise the minor version.
 * OPOS-J needed 1.14.100 to be backward compatible with 1.14.

Therefore, the following steps were taken:

 * Build generation:
    - Updated _Build_Dep.txt so that EVWR is not generated with the other CCOs.
    - Created _Build_EVRW.txt and _Build_EVRW.bat.
    - Update _Build_EVRW.txt as follows:
        o Set MinorVersion=15 and BuildVersion=100.
        o Updated ":DataFiles" to only build "zElectronicValueRW.txt".
    - Update zElectronicValueRW.txt as follows:
        o In ":MethodsProperties" section, set the 1.14.100 APIs to
            release 1.15.
    - Run _Build_EVRW.bat.

 * Correct version from 1.15 to 1.14.100:
    - Load the project into VS2008.
    - Do the following Find and Replace in the EVRW project, selecting Replace
        All for each:
        o 1.15.100 => 1.14.100
        o 1.15     => 1.14.100
        o _1_15    => _1_14_100
    - ElectronicValueRW.rc: Change FILEVERSION and PRODUCTVERSION from 15 to 14.
    > Note-ElectronicValueRWImpl.cpp: Don't change "15 /*MinorVersion*/".
        We will update the API version checking code so that 15 means 1.14.100.

 * ElectronicValueRWImpl.h (Changes marked with CRMMod)
    - Add comment to _nSOMinor definition: 15 = 1.14.100.

 * ElectronicValueRWImpl.cpp (Changes marked with CRMMod)
    - g_ControlVersion: Change from minor version 15 to 14.
    - Open: If ServiceObjectVersion is >= 1.14.100, then set _nSOMinor to 15.
